[1]\r\n\r\nThe Primo Enrichment Common classes are shared classes that can be extended for a variety of use cases.\r\n    \r\nFor more information, see the [API documentation](http://nyulibraries.github.com/primo-enrichment-common/apidocs)\r\n\r\nThe project leverages [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) for managing dependencies, building, packaging and generating Javadocs.\r\n\r\nTo install the package locally, run:\r\n\r\n    $ mvn install\r\n\r\nEnrichment plugins requires the Primo common-api library. To install the library in your local repository\r\n\r\n    Download jar from back office server at: $primo_dev/ng/primo/home/system/publish/client/primo_common-api.jar\r\n    $ mvn install:install-file -Dfile=primo_common-api.jar \\\r\n    -Dpackaging=jar -DgroupId=com.exlibrisgroup.primo \\ \r\n    -DartifactId=primo_common-api -Dversion=1.0\r\n    \r\nThe NYU Libraries uses [Capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano) as its deploy tool. \r\nThe deploy mechanism assumes [rvm](https://rvm.io/ \"Ruby Version Manager\") and \r\n[Ruby 1.9.3-p125](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2012/02/16/ruby-1-9-3-p125-is-released/) \r\non the local deploy host but they may not be necessary. \r\nIn order to deploy: \r\n\r\n    $ cap -S branch=<branch-name> [staging|production] deploy\r\n\r\n[1] [EL Commons](http://exlibrisgroup.org/display/PrimoOI/Enrichment+Plug-In+%28new+version%29, \"Enrichment Plug-In (new version)\")","google":""}
